                "Life as such is challenging and the humans have made it more complicated because life has fallen into class and categories where the rich are getting richer and the poor are dying for food. It is heart-wrenching to see this situation because people are suffering from hunger, lack of education and also some are homeless.Unfortunately, there are many poor people within any society, which is why they need much help from those who have a better life. The inequality gap between the rich and poor has been only growing from year to year irrespective of the fact that the governments have been trying to do something in order to improve the situation. Everyone can help people in some way."<br>"The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little."<br>Donating would mean showing a sense of responsibility towards the betterment of the world.So,let us work together towards the betterment of the poor community.
